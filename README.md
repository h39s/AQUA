# AQUA

Welcome to the AQUA repository! AQUA is a modern platform for audio equalization on Windows. Our goal is to provide a clean user experience and to support many features such as parametric equalization, graphical UIs, and, in the future, saving/loading presets and integrating automatic equalization. We welcome your feedback, so please join our [discord](TODO) server to share your thoughts with us! Stay tuned for more!
