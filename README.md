Welcome to AQUA, a modern platform for audio equalization on Windows. Our goal is to provide a clean user experience and to support many features such as parametric equalization, user friendly graph interfaces, and, in the future, saving/loading presets and AutoEQ integration. Please note that EqualizerAPO is a prerequisite for our application. We would love to get your feedback, address any bugs you encounter, and take any feature requests into consideration as we develop AQUA further, so please join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/44WDeRrr2d)  to share your thoughts with us and stay tuned for more!

## Getting Started

To get started using AQUA, it only takes two easy steps:
1. Install [EqualizerAPO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/) if you don't have it currently installed (and make sure you run `configurator.exe` included as a part of EqualizerAPO to install the required drivers for the devices you would like to EQ).
2. Download and run the executable `AQUA.Setup.x.x.x.exe` from the latest [release](https://github.com/h39s/AQUA/releases).

## Future UI Goal (Rough)

## About the Developers

We are a group of university students in our final year. This is both a passion project and capstone endeavour for us. We will be actively developing the application for the next 6 months and aim to add EQ presets, graphic EQ manipulation, and AutoEQ. Please note that we may not always be available to address your messages on discord as we are all full-time students.

## Development Prerequisites

1. Install [EqualizerAPO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/)
2. Install Visual Studio 2022. Check "Desktop Development with C++"
3. Clone this repository
4. Run `npm install` in the project folder
   - May need to install latest node-gyp in npm ([link](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/docs/Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp.md))
   - When installing `node-gyp`, ensure msvs_version is set to 2022 in npm config
